Answer the following questions:
1. When will a ValueError occur?
2. When will a ZeroDivisionError occur?
3. Could you change the code to avoid the possibility of a ZeroDivisionError?

    if denominator == 0:
        print("Cannot divide by zero!")

Answers:
1. The ValueError will occur when an integer is not entered. A letter for example.
2. The ZeroDivisionError will occur when 0 is entered as the denominator, as the answer will be undefined.
3. Yes
