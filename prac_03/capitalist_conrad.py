"""
CP1404/CP5632 - Practical
Capitalist Conrad wants a stock price simulator for a volatile stock.
The price starts off at $10.00, and, at the end of every day there is
a 50% chance it increases by 0 to 10%, and
a 50% chance that it decreases by 0 to 5%.
If the price rises above $1000, or falls below $0.01, the program should end.
The price should be displayed to the nearest cent (e.g. $33.59, not $33.5918232901)
