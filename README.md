# CP1404 Practicals – Parker Duncanson

## About this Repository

This repository contains my practical work for CP1404 – Programming II.  
Each folder contains code and related files for that week’s practical activity.

I am studying Electrical and Electronic Engineering with a Software focus, and I like golf.

## Clean Code Lessons Learned

Some key clean code lessons I’ve learned in this subject are:

- **Small, single-purpose functions**  
  Each function should do one thing well. This makes programs easier to read, test, and reuse.

- **Meaningful names**  
  Use clear, descriptive names for variables, functions and classes so you can understand the code later without extra comments.

- **Avoid duplication (DRY principle)**  
  If you find the same or very similar code in multiple places, refactor it into a function. This reduces bugs and makes changes easier.

- **Consistent formatting and style**  
  Follow the CP1404 conventions, use tools like “Reformat Code” in PyCharm, and keep code readable for other humans (and your future self).
